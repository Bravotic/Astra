Maybe this should be a virtual machine?
Collin McKinley

I have very little faith in this idea, but maybe Astra should be a virtual machine. This would affect the user very little, but would mean a big difference for how we program it. A virtual machine would allow for a much more consistent experience across all platforms, especially those which we would be more limited on, such as the web. It would also allow for more portable "native extensions" as the extensions would only have to be programmed for the virtual machine, not for the host's machine. The virtual machine could be something like a MOS 6502 emulator, or Z80 emulator. I personally have written a Z80 emulator in the past and I feel most comfortable in working with it. (it was also one of the first computers to get BASIC from Microsoft). That might be an option, however then the BASIC rom we load would have to be made entirely in assembly, something that probably wouldn't be too fun to do. C compilers exist for z80, however we would be massively limited on memory (z80 can only address 64kb maximum), so just like the real C64 we may have to pull some strings to get things working. It would also be possible to create our own bytecode virtual machine, similar to the Java Virtual Machine, however this would be even harder since we would be creating something that doesn't already exist, and hope that people would make the tools needed to create native extension for it. Overall this idea is a long shot but has some real benefits to it.
